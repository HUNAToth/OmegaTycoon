## Gameplay

In **Omega Tycoon**, the player is tasked with building an efficient resource extraction operation on a desolate asteroid. The starting capital allows the purchase of a basic harvester, which collects resources from the asteroid surface. As resources are gathered, the more harvesters or upgrades are available. Strategic investment is essential, as prices for new equipment rise with each purchase.

The player can invest in different types of upgrades to boost production efficiency. The ultimate goal is to maximize resource output, optimize the mining process, and turn the small asteroid operation into a large-scale, profitable venture.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**: The game begins on an empty asteroid. The player is given a small sum of money to start their mining operation.
2. **Buying Harvesters**: Use your initial funds to purchase your first harvester. The price of additional harvesters increases with each new purchase.
3. **Collect Resources**: The harvester will begin mining resources on the asteroid and automatically transport them to the offloading zone.
4. **Upgrade Your Harvesters**: Use your earnings to upgrade your harvesters for better efficiency.
5. **Expand Your Fleet**: Purchase additional harvesters and repeat the process to grow your mining operation.




## Upgrades

As the player progresses, they can invest in harvester upgrades. Each upgrade improves a different aspect of the harvesterâ€™s performance:

- **Movement Speed**: Reduces the time it takes for harvesters to travel between resource deposits and offloading points.
- **Load Capacity**: Increases the maximum amount of resources a harvester can carry at once, reducing the number of trips needed.
- **Load Speed**: Speeds up the time required for a harvester to load its resources, reducing downtime between mining trips.
- **Offload Speed**: Speeds up the time required for a harvester to offload its resources, reducing downtime between mining trips.

Upgrades become increasingly expensive as the game progresses, making it important to plan ahead and invest wisely.

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D**: Move the camera around the asteroid.
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom the camera in and out to get a closer or broader view of your mining operation.
- **Left Mouse Button**: Select a harvester for more information, or use the UI to purchase more harvesters, or upgrade them.
